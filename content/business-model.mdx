Activepieces operates on an open core model, providing a core software platform as open source while offering additional features as proprietary add-on on the cloud.

## How we Determine if a Feature Goes to the Paid or Free Version: 

**Creation:**
We prioritize making features that enhance our existing open source products and primarily benefit individual contributors available for free.

**Collaboration:**
Features that improve team collaboration within Activepieces are generally part of our paid offerings. Yet, if a feature significantly contributes to community growth, we may offer it for free to benefit all users.

**Compliance:**
Features primarily used by enterprises for compliance purposes are considered enterprise features and are included in our paid offerings.

## Paid Offering Benefits to the Open Source Feature Contributions: 

We add new features to the open source version using the resources gained from our paid offerings.

**Security Fixes:**
We promptly address security issues in the open source version with the help of revenue from our paid offerings.

**Support and Guidance:**
We provide support services to open source users until the community becomes self-sustaining.
