Open Source Zapier
------------------

Zapier is not open source. Open source means that you can read its code and there is some license that governs how you can modify, redistribute or run it. We wrote this article as we navigated the different options that can be the "open source zapier" so you don't have to research them.

Why an open source alternative to Zapier?
-----------------------------------------

There are different categories of [Zapier alternatives](https://www.activepieces.com/blog/best-zapier-alternatives) in the market. However, there are a few reasons why you might want to consider an open source no-code business automation tool alternative to Zapier, including:

*   **Cost:** Many open source alternatives are free, whereas Zapier has a very limited free plan.
*   **Customization:** With an open source alternative, you have access to the source code and can customize it to your specific needs.
*   **Security:** Because the source code would be publicly available, users would be able to review and audit the code to ensure that it is secure and respects the privacy of users' data.
*   **Self Hosting:** Allows you to have complete control over where your data is stored and how it is used. This can be particularly important for organizations that are subject to data residency laws or regulations, which mandate that certain types of data must be stored within a specific geographic region.
*   **Community:** Open source projects often have a strong community of developers and users contributing to their development, which can lead to more frequent updates and improvements.
