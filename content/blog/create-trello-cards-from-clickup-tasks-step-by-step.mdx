If you have teams using both ClickUp and Trello for project management, for example, a team who reports issues on ClickUp but a technical team who uses Trello, youâ€™ll need a tool that helps you copy the tasks in realtime between these two apps.

In this guide, weâ€™ll take you step by step through the process of building an automation that creates Trello cards from ClickUp tasks.

###### Prerequisites

Since you plan to copy tasks from ClickUp to Trello, you'll need the following:

*   An [Activepieces](https://cloud.activepieces.com/sign-up) account: You will build your automation on Activepieces.
*   A ClickUp account.
*   A Trello account.

Steps to sync ClickUp Tasks to Trello Cards
-------------------------------------------

In order to keep your Trello in sync with your ClickUp, you will need to follow these steps:

### 1\. Create an Activepieces account

If you have an [Activepieces](https://cloud.activepieces.com/sign-up) account, you can skip this step. Otherwise, go ahead and create a new account. You will build your automation in this account.

### 2\. Create a new automation

If you have flows in your account, click on New flow, or click Start building if this is your first one. Give your flow a name, something like "ClickUp to Trello ðŸ”¥".

This is how my flow looks like before IÂ start adding or modifying the steps:

### 3\. Set up the ClickUp trigger

Click on **Select Trigger**, the sidebar to the right will slide out. Find the **ClickUp** app and choose the **Task Created** trigger. This means your flow will run whenever a new task is added in your ClickUp.

Click on +Â New Connection to connect your ClickUp account. Once connected, you will see a list of the **Workspaces** in your ClickUp account. Choose the one you'd like to listen to new tasks from.

Below these settings, you'll see a Test trigger button, click on it. This will initiate the process of testing the trigger to generate sample data from ClickUp to use in the next steps in your flow. To test it, head to your ClickUp account in another window, go to the Workspace you selected previously, and add a new Task there.

Once the task is added, the testing panel will show you the data from the new task, my screen looked like this at this point:

### 4\. Add a step to create a Trello card

Click on the **+**Â button right under the trigger step in your flow. The sidebar will ask you to choose a piece to use for the new step. Find the **Trello** app, select it and select the **Create Card** action.

Click the **+Â New Connection** button to connect your Trello account. Follow the instructions in the connection popup. Once your account is connected, you will see a list of your existing Trello Boards. Choose the one you'd like to add the new card to. The second dropdown will display the **Lists** in this board. Choose the list you'd like to add the card to.

In the Task Name, we'll use the value from the ClickUp step. Use the Insert Data dropdown to find the ClickUp step, and choose task name from it. This is how IÂ did it:

The same way, go to the **Optional Inputs**, choose **Task Description** if you'd like to add a description to the new card. Use the Insert Data dropdown again to select the **description** property from the ClickUp step. Once you're done, you can test the step to ensure that it works.

This is how my Trello step set up looked like:

### 5\. Test your ClickUp and Trello automation

You're done building, now click on **Test flow** to see if everything is going well. This will show you step by step execution and will tell you if there is any issues and where they come from.

### 6\. Launch your sync between ClickUp and Trello

Congrats! Everything is as planned. Click on the main **Publish** button and your automation flow will launch and start running in the background. Once it's published, you'll see a toggle button that allows you to turn on and off the flow at any time.
