I previously thought **Facebook Business Verification** was a straightforward task: You answer some questions about your business (legal name, address, ..) and you get verified in a day or two — until I had this experience.

Facebook Business Verification and Access Verification getting rejected
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

My last experience proved otherwise. When I submitted our information correctly to Facebook to verify Activepieces, I got surprised that we were rejected. I did it several times (like 10 times) and still got rejected.

What was confusing about it is that I failed to find any single way to get in touch with humans to understand their uncommunicated requirements and comply with them.

Asked YC community for Facebook Verification advice
---------------------------------------------------

Activepieces is backed by Y Combinator, so we're part of its community. I went on our internal network (Bookface) and asked if anyone had experience with this. A fellow founder offered help, he was generous that we jumped on a call and he explained the solution.

‍

Don't submit your documents for Facebook Verification
-----------------------------------------------------

That was his advice. He told me that Facebook uses a 3rd party company to verify businesses, and instead of submitting our documents to Facebook, we should verify ourselves with the 3rd party company, then verify with Facebook using our record with the 3rd party.

It sounded unconventional, he confirmed that but said it worked for them. He advised me to take that shortcut rather than wasting time with Facebook's processes.

‍

Verify your business with Dun & Bradstreet
------------------------------------------

The 3rd party verifier that works in the back-office for Facebook is [Dun & Bradstreet](https://www.dnb.com/). You will get a D-U-N-S number from them, then verify with Facebook again.

I did it and here is how you can do it too:

### 1\. Get your D-U-N-S Number

[Go here](https://www.dnb.com/duns/get-a-duns.html) to start getting your D-U-N-S number from d&b. Follow the procedure on that page till the end. During the process, it will ask you whether you'd like your D-U-N-S number to get [expedited](https://www.dnb.com/marketing/media/dunsfile.html). I chose not to expedite it and thought it could be a quick process already.

I applied on 2 Jan and received our D-U-N-S number on 12 Jan. It took 10 days without expediting and with some back and forth work with their d&b's team.

This is not an advice that it will take 10 days for you too, it could take longer or shorter, and that was my only experience with getting the number.

‍

### 2\. Wait for a few days

While Facebook uses d&b in the background to verify businesses, it looks like the data doesn't sync instantly. Once you get your D-U-N-S number, give it 3-4 days until Facebook can read it.

‍

### 3\. Verify your business on Facebook

It's time to go to your business on Facebook again and try to verify it. When it asks you for your business details (legal name, address, your name, EIN, ..) make sure that you enter them the same way you did on d&b so it can match automatically with your record.

If you don't remember how you entered them, you can [look up your D-U-N-S number](https://www.dnb.com/duns-number/lookup.html) and copy the information to Facebook.

You will know if the data matched with d&b if Facebook doesn't ask you to upload your legal documents. If it does, this means they weren't able to find your record (yet).

If they have your record, you will ask you to select your matching record and proceed with the verification. Go ahead and submit your verification request!

‍

### 4\. Wait until Facebook verifies your business

This took a couple of hours for us after submitting the verification request. It could take a couple of days instead. All what you have to do is to wait until they let you know about your status.

Help your friends with Facebook Verification
--------------------------------------------

It was upsetting for me to get through all that and without practical information on the internet. If you think this can help a friend of yours, share the information with them and contribute to their successful business journey.
