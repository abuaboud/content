## Introduction:

First, let's understand what unopinionated software means. It refers to creating software that doesn't force specific choices or opinions on the users. 

Two good examples of such software are VSCode and React. They offer flexibility and customization options by allowing users to add extra features through plugins or packages.

Now, let's discuss how we achieve this unopinionated approach at Activepieces.

## Striking the Balance: Customization and Simplicity 

At Activepieces, we understand that not every business requires every available feature. Our primary focus is on simplicity, ensuring that complexity is kept to a minimum.

To achieve this goal, we have developed an innovative concept called **pieces.** These pieces serve as building blocks, empowering users to extend the software without any limitations. By leveraging these pieces, users can customize to their specific requirements.

Our objective is to make the entire experience easily understandable. We intentionally encapsulate niche features within these pieces to prevent overwhelming users. With Activepieces, you can grasp the software's capabilities quickly.

If you're eager to explore more about our framework, detailed information can be found in our developer documentation available at https://www.activepieces.com/docs/developers/overview.
